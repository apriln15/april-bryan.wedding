        %h4 How We Met
        %p Back in 2009, Bryan accepted a job at a software company in Las Colinas, TX. Little did he know that, at the time, that he would meet his future wife through mutual friends. In January 2010, Bryan and April met each other at a local band's concert at the Ridglea Theater in Fort Worth, TX. However, this ended up being just as a casual encounter. It wouldn't be till later until April and Bryan started to get to know each other.

        %p Several months later, Bryan and April again met each other at another local band's show, this time at the Skillman Street Pub in Garland, TX. This time, both of them hit it off. Through several conversations on Facebook and text, Bryan and April began to get to know each other and started developing feelings for each other. It was on September 2nd, 2010 that Bryan asked April out and their journey together began. Bryan had, unfortunately, planned a road trip to the Hatch Chili Festival and that caused Bryan and April spend the first few days of their relationship away from each other. However, this was just minor bump in the road. Their relationship grew stronger each year, eventually moving in with each other in 2011. After 4 years of being together and growing stronger as couple, the next chapter in their life was about to begin: marriage.

        %h4 The Proposal
        %p The first vacation we ever went on together was Galveston back in Spring 2011. April was just finishing up her B.S in Biology at the University of Texas at Arlington and we had been dating for about 6 months. The honeymoon phase was coming to an end and we had survived our first holiday season together. As a child, I always went on family vacations and I thought it would be a great tradition to start with me and April (a tradition we have kept every year with the exception of the year we bought the house). Galveston 2011 was a good trip. It was really the first time we got to know each other (we were not living together yet) and really get to learn each others personalities, habits, and grow closer. Since then, we have been to a bunch of other places together such as New York City and San Francisco. We have even been to Hatch, New Mexico - the very first place I went after we immediately started dating. But Galveston was always a special trip because it started a new chapter for us.

        %p Around 5 years later, roughly around the same time we went to Galveston in 2011, I knew I was ready to propose. I had known for a while, actually, but I struggled to find the perfect moment, time, venue, location, etc. When I went to buy the ring, that made matters worse because there are even services that help guys propose and work with your budget; something I found a bit silly and intimidating. But it was shortly after I bought the ring when I knew where I wanted to propose: Galveston, TX.

        %p Minus driving down in the same car and staying in the same hotel, I coordinated the day in such a way to recreate our first trip down there. We drove the same route, tried to make the same stops, and see the same things on the trip. I even managed to wear the same outfit. Once we got in Galveston and checked-in, we got ready and went to same place we went to eat the first night, the first time, we went to Galveston: Giados. We enjoyed our meal, chatted, talked about what we wanted to do, and then proceeded back to the hotel. Now, the first time we went, we stayed at the Hotel Galvez but really didn't have the best view. This time, though, we stayed at the Galvestonian and had a perfect view of the gulf. Researching before I booked the hotel, I knew this was the spot.

        %p Yet, I wasn't looking for a cheesy, on-the beach, traditional proposal. I wanted something a little more private and personal. April and I very much the type to stay home and relax, so with our beach-style hotel room (which looked more like a house) and the perfect view, this was the spot. An hour or so after we got back from Gaidos, we were relaxing on the balcony and I told April I had a gift for her and asked her to come in to see (side note, at this point, I was so nervous my original plan had gone by the wayside and things became a blur and everything I was planning to do did not happen). Then, getting on one knee, I asked her to marry me and she immediately said yes. After we got engaged, we made the decision not to tell anyone till we got home (3 days later). And like the first time we went to Galveston, our second time started another chapter in our lives.
